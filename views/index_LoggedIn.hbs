                <p>Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which the body becomes resistant to the normal effects of insulin and gradually loses the capacity to produce enough insulin in the pancreas.

                <h2>Gestational Diabetes</h2>
                <p>
                    Gestational diabetes mellitus (sometimes referred to as GDM) is a form of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy.
                    Most women will no longer have diabetes after the baby is born. However, some women will continue to have high 
                    blood glucose levels after deliver. It is diagnosed when higher than normal blood glucose levels first appear during 
                    pregnancy.

                    In most cases, gestational diabetes doesn't show noticeable signs or symptoms. Increased thirst and more frequent urination are possible symptoms.
